USC </FONT></B></CENTER><IMG height=3 src="" width="100%"> 
<P>An intelligent agent is a software system capable of combining cognition, 
perception and action in behaving autonomously, purposively and flexibly in some 
environment. One major class of intelligent agents we investigate is ones that 
access and manage distributed information and systems. Such agents provide 
information and assistance to both people and other software systems in network 
and web-based environments. A second major class we investigate is intelligent 
agents that behave, and frequently even look, like people. These virtual humans 
model, guide, educate, train, or entertain real people in simulation, web, and 
virtual environments. 
<P>A Multiagent system is a cohort of intelligent agents and people capable of 
coordinating itself in behaving autonomously, purposively and flexibly in some 
environment. A multiagent system might consist of a set of web-based intelligent 
information agents that extract and integrate information from a set of 
distributed sources; a group of people and virtual humans working, or playing, 
together in a virtual world; or a combination of people and intelligent 
interface agents (to people and other software and hardware systems) that 
provide a coordinated virtual enterprise embedded in the real world. 
<P>We are one of the world leaders in the area of intelligent agents and 
multiagent systems, both from a research perspective and a sociological one. We 
cover a broad research scope within this area. We have a strong presence in both 
the construction of individual agents and the coordination of multiple agents. 
We also include major contributors in the creation of both virtual humans and 
web-based information agents. We founded the annual Autonomous Agents 
conference, and continue to have a very strong presence there; for example, at 
Agents 2000 in Barcelona, Spain, USC led the way with over twice as many 
accepted papers as the next most successful university (19% of the accepted 
papers were from USC as compared to 8% from second best Carnegie Mellon 
University). We have played a significant role in the International Conference 
on Multi-Agent Systems, including program co-chair for 2000. We are on the board 
of directors of the International Foundation for Multi-Agent Systems, and a 
Trustee of the Robocup foundation. We include three former Chairs of the ACM 
Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence (SIGART) and the President of 
the International AI in Education Society. We also include two Fellows of the 
American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and former AAAI 
Councilors, plus the current AAAI Conference Chair. <IMG height=3 src=""

<P>Following are links to different research groups working at USC. 
<P><A href="http://www.isi.edu/divisions/div3/index.html">Intelligent Systems 
Division </A>
<P><A href="http://robotics.usc.edu/">USC Robotics Labs </A>
<P><A href="http://www.ict.usc.edu/">Institute for Creative Technologies </A>
<P>The Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) is developing experience 
learning systems that incorporate virtual humans, high resolution graphics, and 
immersive audio with interactive stories. To this end the ICT is working in 
collaboration with IMSC to develop the immersive audio capability and with ISI 
to develop more realistic behavior models for the virtual humans, who can play 
the roles of characters and coaches in the scenarios. The current research 
includes the modeling of emotion, perceptual attention and gaze, natural 
language understanding to support interactive dialogue, and the integration of 
these components in an animated body with an expressive face. There is also a 
strong connection to graphics research as we seek to create simulations with 
highly realistic scenes, human bodies and faces. ICT has a graphics group, which 
will collaborate with computer science, IMSC, and the School of 
Cinema-Television. We anticipate that future research at ICT will also focus on 
the development of networked versions of these simulations, thus there will be a 
need to investigate network technologies and high performance computing to 
support scenarios with large numbers of virtual humans. <IMG height=3 src=""

<P><B>Interconnection between Agents and the department </B>
<P>The area of intelligent agents and multiagent systems connects with the 
department's natural language, brain modeling, robotics, and graphics groups in 
investigating various of the components underlying intelligent agents and 
multiagent systems, and in developing more comprehensive systems; for example, 
in understanding how to construct humanoids (artificial human-like entities 
based on software and/or hardware). It connects with the department's scalable 
distributed systems group, user interface and internet computing group, and 
networking group in investigating coordinated organizations of distributed 
entities. And it connects with key organizations both within and outside of the 
university in pursuing a range of informational, educational, training, 
engineering and entertainment applications. Members of the group have, in 
addition to their affiliations with the Computer Science Department, 
affiliations with the Information Sciences Institute (ISI), the Integrated Media 
Systems Center (IMSC), the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT), the IMPACT 
laboratory, the Departments of Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering (AME) and 
Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL). Collaborations within the University extend beyond these organizations in 
which we have direct involvement, to include the College of Letters, Arts and 
Sciences, the Keck School of Medicine, the School of Gerontology, the Annenberg 
School of Communications, the Rossier School of Education, and the School of 
Cinema-Television. Collaborations outside of the University are too numerous to 
list. </P></BODY></HTML>
